        "title": "Trie-Based Dictionary Reimplementation (C)",
        "description": "Rebuilt an array-based dictionary into a Trie-based data structure, preserving the abstract data type’s interface. Eliminated hardcoded size constraints and improved lookup/set speed via recursive node operations. Maintained strict memory safety and clean pointer logic throughout."
      },
      {
        "title": "Interactive Bellman-Ford Path Visualizer (Python)",
        "description": "Designed an interactive game-like simulation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, styled as a treasure hunt. Built a fixed graph using island images for nodes and ocean paths for edges, with dynamic glowing of user-selected paths. Highlighted the optimal path and displayed a final success message to complete the animated gameplay."
      },
      {
        "title": "Performance Analysis of Splay Trees (Java)",
        "description": "Simulated splay trees under skewed query patterns to demonstrate their near-constant amortized access time. Benchmarked against naive BSTs and presented results using comparative trend plots. Conveyed empirical insights clearly without relying on formal theory."
      },
      {
        "title": "HyperLogLog Neighbor Optimizer (Python)",
        "description": "Optimized the getnearest neighbors() routine in a probabilistic HyperLogLog structure. Rewrote logic using vectorization and smarter iteration to handle large-scale queries efficiently. Preserved functional correctness while significantly improving runtime performance."
      },
      {
        "title": "Ultra-Large Integer Optimization (Python + C)",
        "description": "Rewrote performance-critical sections of a Python-based large integer processing app in C. Implemented a custom big-integer ADT, integrated via ctypes, and managed builds with Makefile. Achieved significant speedup on large-scale integer datasets."
