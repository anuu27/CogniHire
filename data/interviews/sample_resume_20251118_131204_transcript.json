    {
      "question": "What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?",
      "answer": "Overfitting is when the training error is very less so that it becomes 0 but the model doesn't perform well on the testing data.",
      "type": "role"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cross-validation, and why is it used?",
      "answer": "Cross validation is just splitting the data set into few sets and ensuring and using one as a validation set and trading set so that the model model model gets trained more better and avoids generalization.",
      "type": "role"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you evaluate the performance of an AI model?",
      "answer": "The performance of an AI model can be evaluated using few metrics its accuracy, pressure and also F1 score depending on the requirements of the model.",
      "type": "role"
    },
    {
      "question": " What is reinforcement learning, and how does it differ from supervised learning?",
      "answer": "Reinforcement learning takes a feedback from the human to improve the model but supervised learning trains based on the available data set with labels.",
      "type": "role"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle missing or corrupted data when training AI models?",
      "answer": "I handle missing or corporate data using imputation or methods that remove the missing data and also add something accounts to that.",
